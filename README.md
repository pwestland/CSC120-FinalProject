# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

I wanted to make something that was simple, but not too boring or super short.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

There were definitely a few things I had to use the java docs for regarding the best java methods to use for various tasks.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?

I wish I'd been able to make the task checklist work better, it doesn't quite operate how I wanted it to, partly because I tried to keep my number of tasks fairly low for the sake of simplicity.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

I really wanted to add more of a story, like the player waking up with amnesia and having to discover clues to who they are and what's going on as they try to escape. I also would add more rooms, a wider range of tasks, more NPCs, maybe a time limit, and much more variety in the outcome of the game. I also would add better transitions and descriptions for the rooms, challenges, etc.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

When I met with Jordan and we talked about keeping things simple and then building from there, because initially I think I was trying to tackle too much at once.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

Well, I did have some extenuating circumstances since I was very sick for a lot of this semester, especially for the work time of this project, I would tell myself to try to start earlier and break it all inro smaller pieces so that I'm not doing it largely in one night. It's very difficult for me not to procrastinate because of my ADHD and other learning disabilities, but I still would give myself that advice. Also, if I could go back a little earlier, I would've tried harder to look for a partner, because it's very motivating to work with someone else and also super helpful for troubleshooting and finding and fixing bugs.

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
